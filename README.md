#### About the Project
Are you a rundown romance novel ghostwriter tired of coming up with your own titles?
Maybe your love life needs a little refresh and you want to make a custom cover to
share with your sweetheart? In any case, **___Emma and Kyle's RomCom Cover Generator___**
has got you covered!

Have fun with our **Random Cover** button to see a variety of covers,
titles, and taglines. See one you can't live without? Then smash that **Save Cover** button, friend, and send that baby to your **Saved Covers** section!

If none of the random covers strike your fancy, or you just feel like getting creative,
try out the **Make Your Own Cover** feature! With this form you can add your own picture, devise a title, and throw in a couple spicy
taglines.

Once you've crafted your perfect cover, go ahead and click the **Make My Book**
button to reap the fruits of your romantic labor. While you're at it, you can click that **Save
Cover** button and add your custom cover to your **Saved Covers** section.

 Want to admire the treasure trove of tomes you've stashed away? Then click that **View Saved Covers** button!
