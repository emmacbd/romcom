### About the Project
Are you a rundown romance novel ghostwriter tired of coming up with your own titles?
Maybe your love life needs a little refresh and you want to make a custom cover to
share with your sweetheart? In any case, Emma and Kyle's RomCom Cover Generator
has got you covered!

Have fun with our Random Cover button to see a variety of covers,
titles, and taglines. See one you can't live without? Then smash that save button, friend!
If none of the random covers strike your fancy, or you just feel like getting creative,
try out the Make Your Own feature! With this form you can add your own picture (or
any fair use .jpg or .png image of your choice), devise a title, and throw in a couple spicy
taglines. Once you've crafted your perfect cover, go ahead and click the Make My Book
button to reap the fruits of your romantic labor. While you're at it, you can click that save
cover button and add your custom cover to your saved covers section. Want to admire the
treasure
